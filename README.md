This repository contains my completed Jupyter Notebooks and five Dash applications from the Coursera courses Data Analysis with Python (https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python) and Data Visualization with Python (https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization), both from IBM.
